# Calculus Central

## Project Description

**Calculus Central** is designed to address a common challenge faced by students globally: accessing comprehensive and structured calculus resources in one unified platform. The application centralizes various learning materials, including video lectures, practice problems, and progress tracking features, to facilitate the learning experience. By integrating these resources, the application aims to eliminate the hardship that often complicates the learning process, enabling students to focus on mastering calculus concepts efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Students of calculus are often required to navigate through an overwhelming array of resources scattered across textbooks, websites, and video platforms. This dispersion not only makes it difficult to find high-quality materials but also hinders the ability to track learning progress effectively. **Calculus Central** seeks to solve this problem by grouping selected resources into a single, easily navigable platform. 

## Primary Users

The primary users of **Calculus Central** will be students seeking a structured and comprehensive approach to learning calculus. This includes high school and college students who are enrolled in calculus courses or anyone looking to self-study calculus from the ground up. By providing a centralized platform for learning and revision, the application aims to support students in achieving their academic goals with greater efficiency.
